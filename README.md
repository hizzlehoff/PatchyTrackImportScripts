# Patchy Track Import Scripts.
![Alt text](PatchyTrack.gif?raw=true "Well, hello there.")

Import Scripts for data exported from the iOS app: Patchy track.
http://www.bannaflak.com/patchy-track/

Patchy track captures camera motion and video during an AR session. This data can then be exported and used offline.

Currently only a Blender importer is available. If you'd like to use the data in another 3D package please import it into Blender and export it as an .fbx or other compatible format.

[ Work in progress ]
